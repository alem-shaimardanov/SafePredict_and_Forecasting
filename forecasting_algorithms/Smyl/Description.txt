Name of forecasting method: Exponential Smoothing - Recurrent Neural Network (ES-RNN) Hybrid Models

Hybrid models, mixing hand-coded parts, like some Exponential Smoothing (ES) formulas, with a black-box Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) forecasting engine. 
The models do not constitute an ensemble of Exponential Smoothing (ES) and Neural Networks (NN) â€“ instead, they are truly hybrid algorithms in which all parameters,
like the initial ES seasonality and smoothing coefficients, are fitted concurrently with the NN weights by the same Gradient Descent method.
Additionally, these are hierarchical models, in a sense that they use both global, applicable to all series, parameters (the NN weights) and per-time- series 
parameters (like seasonality and smoothing coefficients).
