This is a combined-based method that uses 24 forecasting methods (mostly statistical models such as ETS, ARIMA, Temporal HIErarchical Forecasting(THIEF), 
MAPA and several ML models such as bagging and neural networks). The key criterion for choosing a forecasting method was that it had been analyzed empirically 
using forecasting competition datasets or benchmarks.The point forecasts submitted finished fourth in the M4-competitions based on the overall weighted average 
error measure and second based on the symmetric mean absolute percent error (sMAPE).
