The method combines seven statistical methods and a ML one, with the weights that are utilized forthe averaging being calculated by a ML algorithm which is 
trained to minimize the forecasting errors through holdout tests for each individual series. The proposed approach involves two phases. 

First, it utilizes a set of time series to train a meta-model which assigns weights to different possible forecasting algorithms with the goal of minimizing 
the average forecasting loss obtained from a weighted forecast combination. The inputs to the meta-model are features that are extracted from each series. 

Then, in the second phase, the method performs forecasts on unseen series using a weighted forecast combination, where the weights are received from the 
previously trained meta-model. 

Montero-Manso etal.â€™s method has shown second-best results for prediction intervals and point forecasts in the M4-competition for yearly, quarterly, monthly,
weekly, daily and hourly data. The method has the most accurate predictions for time series data from demographicand industrial domains.
